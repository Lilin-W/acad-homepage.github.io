# 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi, I'm **Lilin Wang**, a second-year master's student in Electrical and Systems Engineering at the **University of Pennsylvania**.

I'm a Research Assistant at the **Perelman School of Medicine**, advised by Prof. [Zhi Huang](https://www.zhihuang.ai/) in the [Huang Lab](https://www.zhihuang.ai/lab-members). My current work centers on TissueLab [[website](https://www.tissuelab.org/)] [[![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zhihuanglab/TissueLab?style=social)](https://github.com/zhihuanglab/TissueLab)], a co-evolving agentic AI system for medical imaging analysis.

I received my B.Eng. in Data Science and Big Data Technology, jointly awarded by the University of Liverpool and Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University (XJTLU).

My research focuses on **AI for healthcare**, with particular interest in medical image analysis and large language models (LLMs) for clinical and biomedical applications. I'm interested in how intelligent systems can connect human expertise, data, and computation to support diagnosis, discovery, and clinical decision-making.

I enjoy collaborating across disciplines and building AI systems that make real-world healthcare more accessible and reliable. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to connect! 😊
