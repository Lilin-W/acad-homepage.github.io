## 🌿 About Her Name

Her name carries a little story.

Her last name "Xia" (夏) comes from the day we first met — it was **Lixia** (立夏), the **Start of Summer** in the traditional Chinese calendar.

A few days later, when I brought her home, it happened to be **Xiaoman** (小满) — another solar term meaning "just full enough."

In Chinese culture, Xiaoman represents a quiet kind of contentment — being full, but not overflowing.

There's an old saying, *"Xiaoman sheng wanquan"* (小满胜万全), meaning the happiest moments in life often come from things that are perfectly enough, not completely full.

It's the feeling of grains almost ripe — full but not overflowing — a symbol of balance, warmth, and quiet happiness.
